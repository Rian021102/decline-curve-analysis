# AUTOMATIC DECLINE CURVE

## Project Background
The Arps method for Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) remains the most prevalent approach for estimating the Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) of oil and gas fields. This method involves monitoring the declining production rates from a well. The observed trend is then modeled using a curve fit. Extrapolating this curve to a point where production reaches zero—or a predetermined economic limit—allows for an estimation of the total cumulative production over the well's lifecycle, thereby providing a reserve estimate.
Using the Arps method for Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) on each well individually can be time-consuming. This project demonstrates how employing a programming language like Python to automate the DCA for each well in a field can significantly streamline the process. The project involves connecting to a database—specifically using DuckDB in this case. The workflow is straightforward: data is ingested from the database using an SQL script and processed in Python, where each well is analyzed sequentially. The integration with Streamlit provides a user interface that simplifies analyzing the DCA results. The outcomes for each well are stored in a new table and can be displayed on a dashboard, offering clear insights for further development of the field.
